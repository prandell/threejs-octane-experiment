## Technology Used

- Three.js
- Dat.gui

## Setup

Please be aware the setup to build and run this website differs respective to each operating system (OS). Furthermore, I'm also assuming that you already have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) already installed or available within your environment.

To experiment with the Octane Model, uncomment all the Debug Console comments, and use the sliders to alter the Camera, Lights, and Octane Colours.

### Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
This will then launch the application within the native web browser on your computer, and you will see Octane spinning

### Build

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Acknowledgements

This simple application was made whilst following the Udemy course below - but modified to be typescript instead of plain js.
